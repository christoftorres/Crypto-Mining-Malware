- How many websites of the top 1 milion are doing cryptomining?
- WHat kind of websites, thus what category incorporates most of the cryptomining? Torrent websites? Illegal websites?
- Are they all aware? Thus are they doing it on purpose or have they been hacked?
- Are there any big players? Or does every website implement it's own cryptimining script?
- Do they make use of the CPU only or do they also use the GPU e.g. WebGL?
- Which currency do they mine? Do they mine a static cryptocurrency or do they switch between cryptocurrencies?
- What are the ways to mitigate this? Are there any countermeasures available?
- If not, is it possible to build a small countermeasure via a web extension that detects this and tries to block this script?
- Check if the found websites ask for the consent of the user.
- Check if antivirus software, maybe virustotal detects such things.
- Apparently there is a browser extension called "Install no coin" that alerts and blocks mining activity. Check out of it works!
